# URL-Shortner
Shorten URLs

### Explanation of the Shortener  
1) User visits the website  
        This will require us to host the website in order for it to be used, no problem
2) User puts their URL into a textbox  
        This will require an interactive textbox on the site screen. Might also be important to pretty the site up.
3) User gets back a shortened URL  
        The URL the user puts in needs to be taken and stored into a text document/hash along with the shortcut they are given.
4) Every time the user uses the short URL they are redirected to the real one  
        This will require pulling the URL they put in for processing which will match it with the full URL and then redirect them.
