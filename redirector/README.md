This is an explanation of what this is. If you download it (or move it into codiad), you will need to run the redirect.pl file.
The sites.pm module has 4 sites stored by default. They are keyed to the shorts of aa, ab, ac, and ad. The app WILL NOT RUN without
this file. This file also includes the script to match a key to a site. It shouldn't be too hard to use something else to do the 
data storage for us.
